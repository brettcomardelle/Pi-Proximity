# Pi-Proximity
This python script is used with an ultrasonic range sensor, led, and a buzzer in order to create a proximity alarm sensor.

#Description:
When an object is less than or equal to 3ft away from the sensor, the buzzer will sound and the LED is high. Otherwise, the buzzer is silent and the LED is low.

#Use:
This python script was created for a Raspberry Pi single-board computer and is written in Python 2. It does require the knowledge of building the circuit. Be sure to change the GPIO pins and range distance to your liking.
